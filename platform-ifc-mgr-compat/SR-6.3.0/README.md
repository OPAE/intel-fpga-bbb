Updates for the SR-6.3.0 release given an untarred copy of sr630_wHSSI_skxp_pr_pkg.tar.gz.

The transformed build environment is compatible only with OPAE, since the platform interface
manager is integrated into the OPAE SDK. The blue/green boundary remains unchanged and builds
are compatible with the standard SR-6.3.0 FIU.

HSSI is not supported.
