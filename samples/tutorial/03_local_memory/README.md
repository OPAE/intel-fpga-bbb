# Local Memory

By *local memory*, we mean memory that is directly attached to FPGA pins. The
PIM is consistent in naming any locally attached memory (DDR, HBM, etc.)
*local memory*. Ports to host memory are always named *host channels*, since I/O
with the host is often a combination of DMA and CSR traffic. *Host channels*
were described in the original [hello world](../01_hello_world) example.

Like host channels and clocks, local memory is passed to the ofs\_plat\_afu()
top-level module in the plat\_ifc wrapper interface. Also similar to host
channels, the PIM provides bridges for local memory with protocol translations
to Avalon-MM or AXI-MM as well as optional clock crossing.

## Example Code

The sample code here has two variants, one with AXI ports to local memory
and one with Avalon. The majority of code is common. Both examples use the
same CCI-P host interface. The host interface protocol and local memory
protocols are completely independent.

The example builds a simple CSR interface controlled by the host, implemented
with a CCI-P interface. The CSR logic in [common/mem\_csr.sv](hw/rtl/common/mem_csr.sv)
sends commands to an FSM in [common/mem\_fsm.sv](hw/rtl/common/mem_fsm.sv) over
an Avalon memory channel. The FSM generates requests to local memory.

The example is driven by software in the [sw](sw) directory. Build and run it
using the same steps as the previous examples.

## AXI

The AXI variant instantiates a vector of
[ofs\_plat\_axi\_mem\_if](https://github.com/OPAE/ofs-platform-afu-bbb/blob/master/plat_if_develop/ofs_plat_if/src/rtl/base_ifcs/axi/ofs_plat_axi_mem_if.sv)
interfaces, one for each memory bank, in [axi/ofs\_plat\_afu.sv](hw/rtl/axi/ofs_plat_afu.sv).
The ofs\_plat\_axi\_mem\_if interface is the same definition used for AXI DMA
streams connected to host memory in the [hello world](../01_hello_world) example.
The module ofs\_plat\_local\_mem\_as\_axi\_mem instantiates a bridge from the
platform's base interface to AXI. The PIM provides the same portable module name
on any platform, independent of the actual protocol of the base interface. The
AFU source is thus portable across platforms, even when platforms change the
native local memory interface.

In addition to the protocol translation, the example commands
ofs\_plat\_local\_mem\_as\_axi\_mem to instantiate a clock crossing from
each memory bank's native clock to the host channel's clock. As a result, all
AFU interfaces operate in a common clock domain.

Logic in [axi/afu\_top.sv](hw/rtl/axi/afu_top.sv) maps commands from the FSM
to local memory AXI requests. Of course a production AFU is likely to employ
a single protocol universally instead of this combination of Avalon and AXI.
Avalon is used here in the FSM to avoid rewriting a module that isn't central
to the example.

The AXI example can be configured for simulation with:

```console
$ afu_sim_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_axi.txt build_sim
```

or synthesis with:

```console
$ afu_synth_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_axi.txt build_synth
```

## Avalon

The Avalon variant has very similar structure to the AXI variant. It instantiates
a vector of [ofs\_plat\_avalon\_mem\_if](https://github.com/OPAE/ofs-platform-afu-bbb/blob/master/plat_if_develop/ofs_plat_if/src/rtl/base_ifcs/avalon/ofs_plat_avalon_mem_if.sv)
Avalon interfaces in [avalon/ofs\_plat\_afu.sv](hw/rtl/avalon/ofs_plat_afu.sv)
and maps the platform's local memory base interface by invoking
ofs\_plat\_local\_mem\_as\_avalon\_mem. The logic in
[avalon/afu\_top.sv](hw/rtl/avalon/afu_top.sv) passes commands from the FSM to
the local memory Avalon interfaces.

Like the AXI code, the Avalon example adds a clock crossing to each local memory
bank by passing a target clock to ofs\_plat\_local\_mem\_as\_avalon\_mem and setting
ADD\_CLOCK\_CROSSING.

The Avalon example can be configured for simulation with:

```console
$ afu_sim_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_avalon.txt build_sim
```

or synthesis with:

```console
$ afu_synth_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_avalon.txt build_synth
```

## Debugging

Like host channels, event logging is available for local memory. Transaction logs
are written to log\_ofs\_plat\_local\_mem.tsv (for ASE, in the "work" directory).
Any interface with LOG_CLASS set to ofs\_plat\_log\_pkg::LOCAL\_MEM, including
interfaces instantiated at any point in AFU sources, will log to this file.
