# Clocking

Every interface crossing the partial reconfiguration boundary into an AFU has
an associated clock. Every PIM interface has an internal clk and reset_n.
A collection of standard global clocks is passed into AFUs. The PIM wraps
these clocks in struct t\_ofs\_plat\_std\_clocks, defined in
$OPAE\_PLATFORM\_ROOT/hw/lib/build/platform/ofs\_plat\_if/rtl/base\_ifcs/clocks/ofs\_plat\_clocks.vh, which is derived from
[ofs\_plat\_clocks.vh](https://github.com/OPAE/ofs-platform-afu-bbb/blob/master/plat_if_develop/ofs_plat_if/src/rtl/base_ifcs/clocks/ofs_plat_clocks.vh). The structure is
passed to ofs\_plat\_afu as plat\_ifc.clocks. Both the pClk and
uClk\_usr families defined in t\_ofs\_plat\_std\_clocks are aligned. pClk is
fixed frequency, and is always the clock used for the primary host channel.
The frequency of uClk\_usr is configurable at AFU load time.

Each of the clocks in t\_ofs\_plat\_std\_clocks is a standard t\_ofs\_plat\_clock\_reset\_pair,
consisting of clock and reset.

## Clock crossing with the PIM

AFUs are free to manage clock crossing. The PIM offers automated insertion of clock
crossing briges for most interfaces. Modules that support clock crossing have an ADD\_CLOCK\_CROSSING parameter along with afu\_clk and afu\_reset\_n ports. When ADD\_CLOCK\_CROSSING is set, AFUs must pass in the target clock/reset pair for the
AFU interface in afu\_clk and afu\_reset\_n. When ADD\_CLOCK\_CROSSING is 0 these
ports are ignored.

## User Clock Frequency

The frequency of the user clock can be set in the AFU JSON. The setting
triggers two changes:

1. The Quartus project updates the configuration of the user clock and sets
the proper frequency, enabling timing analysis to apply the chosen
frequency. The frequency is read directly from the AFU JSON during timing
analysis.

2. The AFU JSON is packaged with the compiled bitstream in the generated GBS
file. At load time, fpgaconf configures the user-specified clocks.

In addition to specific uClk\_usr frequencies, an AFU's JSON descriptor may set
the uClk\_usr frequency to "auto". In this case, an agressive target frequency
is set during place and route. At the end of compilation, timing analysis
is invoked and the actual fMAX achieved is calculated. The JSON packaged
with the resulting compiled bitstream is updated with the actual uClk\_usr
fMAX achieved.

The frequency of uClk\_usr reported during simulation is often incorrect, even
in a properly configured system. The frequency the sample program reports when
running with a synthesized AFU is expected to be correct, though perhaps slightly
below the target frequency because uClk\_usr frequencies are not infinitely
configurable.

## Examples

Two sample AFUs are provided, with both sharing identical RTL and software.
Both request a clock crossing for the host channel DMA and MMIO interfaces
to uClk\_usr. The first, [clock\_freq\_uClk\_310.json](hw/rtl/clock_freq_uClk_310.json)
sets the frequency of uClk\_usr to 310 MHz. The second,
[clock\_freq\_uClk\_auto.json](hw/rtl/clock_freq_uClk_auto.json), sets the
frequency of uClk\_usr based on the achieved fMAX of place and route.

Set up a simulation build of the fixed frequency version with:

```console
$ afu_sim_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_uClk_310.txt build_sim_u310
$ cd build_sim_u310
$ make
$ make sim
```

or synthesis with:

```console
$ afu_sim_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_uClk_310.txt build_u310
$ cd build_u310
$ $OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT/bin/afu_synth
```

Build the auto-fMAX version with:

```console
$ afu_sim_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_uClk_auto.txt build_sim_uauto
$ cd build_sim_uauto
$ make
$ make sim
```

or synthesis with:

```console
$ afu_sim_setup --source hw/rtl/sources_uClk_310.txt build_uauto
$ cd build_uauto
$ $OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT/bin/afu_synth
```

In both examples, the host channel memory interfaces (both DMA and MMIO) operate in
the uClk\_usr domain. The clk and reset\_n wires in the two interfaces are updated with
the new clock.

Any global clock could have been used instead of uClk\_usr. To run a design at half
the normal speed, bind afu\_clk to plat\_ifc.clocks.pClkDiv2.clk and afu\_reset\_n to
plat\_ifc.clocks.pClkDiv2.reset_n. The frequency of uClk\_usr may still be set in the
AFU JSON, despite uClk\_usr not being used in the design.
