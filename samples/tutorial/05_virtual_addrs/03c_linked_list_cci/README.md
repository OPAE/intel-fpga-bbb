This example is functionally identical to the [previous linked list
example](../03b_linked_list) but has some key implementation differences.
The RTL is written using plain CCI-P request and response structures, yet
still employs MPF to transform the platform memory semantics. The software
buffer management in [sw/linked_list_malloc.cpp](sw/linked_list_malloc.cpp)
is also changed. Buffers are allocated using standard functions and are not
pinned for FPGA access before the addresses are passed to the FPGA. At the
beginning of March, 2019, MPF/VTP was extended with the option to pin
buffers automatically on reference.

In [hw/rtl/cci_mpf_app_conf.vh](hw/rtl/cci_mpf_app_conf.vh), the
preprocessor variable MPF_CONF_VTP_PT_MODE_SOFTWARE_SERVICE is defined.
This variable enables the automatic pinning of pages on reference in
VTP by setting VTP_PT_MODE to "SOFTWARE_SERVICE" in
[../base/hw/rtl/cci_afu_with_mpf.sv](../base/hw/rtl/cci_afu_with_mpf.sv).
Instead of a hardware page table walker, VTP invokes a software handler
for each miss. The software handler confirms that pages are pinned
before adding them to VTP's private virtual to physical translation table.

In [hw/rtl/linked_list_afu.sv](hw/rtl/linked_list_afu.sv), the
app_afu() module is replaced with a module that maps the incoming MPF
SystemVerilog interface (named fiu) back to CCI-P request and response
structures (cp2af_sTx and af2cp_sTx). There is a 1:1 mapping of all CCI-P
wires to the MPF interface. app_afu() instantiates the linked list
implementation module, app_afu_cci(). The RTL in app_afu_cci() is nearly
identical to the MPF version in the previous example, differing only in the
use of the CCI-P structures and the lack of MPF request header initialization
functions.

RTL coders are free to choose either the MPF or the CCI-P representation,
even in designs that use MPF to transform the memory semantics.

Please refer to the previous linked list example for a description of the
algorithm and compilation and execution instructions.


## Advanced experiment

Change the assignment setting afu.c0Tx.hdr.ext.addrIsVirtual in
[hw/rtl/linked_list_afu.sv](hw/rtl/linked_list_afu.sv) to 0 instead of 1.
Compile the simulator again and re-run the example. ASE will abort,
reporting a read request to an unallocated address. Clearing addrIsVirtual
disables VTP address translation and virtual addresses are passed all the way
to the platform. This is one consequence of choosing to write an AFU using
CCI-P structures instead of MPF interfaces. Control of MPF extension request
headers, such as addrIsVirtual, is necessarily global when using CCI-P
structures.
