Updates for the SR-5.0.3-Release given an untarred copy of SR-5.0.3-Release.tar.gz.

The transformed build environment is compatible only with OPAE, since the platform
interface manager is integrated into the OPAE SDK. The blue/green boundary remains
unchanged and builds are compatible with the standard SR-5.0.3 FIU.
